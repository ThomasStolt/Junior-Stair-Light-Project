# Junior-Stair-Light-Project

This is a stair light project, based on arduino, I created for a friend. Low cost, low effort, still some fun walking up or down the stairs.

I created this for a friend. For several reasons, we connected ground of all LED strips together and lead all the positive leads for switching. Because of that, we had to use that dual-transistor circuit, that I found on the internet, to be able to switch the positive lines.
It is easier to switch the negative lines, that just requires one transistor/MOSFET, so if you do this you should probably go with that approach.
